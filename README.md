Water potability refers to the safety of water for human consumption.

Potable water is free from harmful contaminants and bacteria and is safe for drinking and food preparation.

The World Health Organization considers access to safe drinking water a basic human right.

There are various methods to ensure water potability, including filtration and treatment processes such as UV filtration and reverse osmosis.

In developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, although only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation.

If you are concerned about the potability of your water, you can have it tested by a professional laboratory.

A water potability test is a crucial evaluation of water quality that determines its suitability for humanÂ consumption.
